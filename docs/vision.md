# Anchor — Locked Vision (v1)

> Single track for all agents. Codebase truth: repo HEAD (M1–M5 +
> `domain/routine` + `domain/personalization`, 77 unit tests).
> Planning truth: this file.

## One-liner
Offline grounding button that works in airplane mode. Haptic in <300ms, no quizzes in the acute path, no backend.

## Non-negotiables (locked)
1. **Haptics are the product.** Double Pulse + Breathing In/Out ship first (already in `core/haptics/`). Purr/Marble Tier1. No biometric claims ("89Hz cortisol" dropped).
2. **ANCHOR NOW is hero entry.** Big one-tap button. Volume triple-press DEFERRED (button-first, per team lock).
3. **Offline-first, deterministic.** No network, no LLM/STT/TTS at runtime. Same inputs → same output.
4. **Privacy.** No trauma narrative field, no ambient audio upload, no diagnosis. Ever.
5. **Safety filter overrides everything.** `domain/safety` built (18 tests): `permits()` enforces SF1/SF2/SF4/SF6/SF8 as hard vetoes, `fallback()` guarantees SF7 never-empty screen; SF3 owned by `SessionStateMachine`, SF5 by UI layer. Dissociation → separate pathway, WORSE → SAFETY_STOP, no auto-dial/SMS.
6. **Safety phrase ships.** User-recorded (MediaRecorder) + bundled fallback, <300ms playback.
7. **Dignity SMS via intent.** Pre-written templates ("rough moment, don't need you to do anything…") through `ACTION_SENDTO`, no auto-send — this is the *default* SOS path (no Companion Mode). No Ed25519 for demo. Companion Mode is a separate, opt-in feature: enabling it is the consent to a silent, direct background SMS (`SEND_SMS` + location permissions, `core/companion/CompanionNotificationEngine`) automatically on every SOS hit; the *further* "still distressed after the exercise" alert is a per-tap "Notify Emergency Contact" button on the Critical screen, not automatic — the user decides in the moment whether to send it. Both paths attach a Maps link to the last-known location when Companion Mode's location toggle is on. Name these permissions explicitly on the pitch rather than claiming zero-permission when Companion Mode is on.
8. **Safety plan ships.** Stanley-Brown six-section plan (`domain/safetyplan` model + validator), user-entered text only, display-only — no auto-dial, no auto-SMS. The current app has a local form and safety-stop viewer.
9. **Persistence is on-device only.** Current profile, selected comfort-tool preferences, episode history, outcomes, and safety plan use JSON-backed SharedPreferences. The full ordered `Routine` sequence model is not yet persisted or played.

## Onboarding (locked: one-time quiz OK, never repeated)
One-time structured quiz at onboarding is FINE. Complaint was repeated quizzes, not onboarding. Rule: quiz once → tool becomes functional, never nags again.
Allowed once: PCL-5 (20 items, free, validated) as baseline + functional prefs below. No ITQ/DES at onboarding (labeling + length). No free-text trauma description + classification (diagnosis + re-traumatization + determinism risk).
Flow:
1. PCL-5 once (`domain/assessment`: `Pcl5Catalog` 20 items + `Pcl5Scorer`, cutoff 31, screening-only KDoc; skippable, on-device only, never re-asked unless user opens Settings > Progress)
2. What hits you most? (racing heart / shut down-numb / loud world / flashback-ish / nightmares)
3. What helps, even a little? (hold / breathe / own voice / quiet+dark / reach someone)
4. Sensory prefs (sound on/off, vibration strength from `HapticCapabilities`, work-safe default)
5. Safety phrase (record or bundled) + trusted contact (typed number, template preview) — both skippable
6. Done → ANCHOR NOW
Learning after: Better/Same/Worse only (1 tap) → `domain/personalization/PersonalizationScorer` → insight card ("X helped 4 out of 5 times", MIN_SESSIONS=3). No scales in acute path, no re-quizzing.
Full research flow: S0–S12 in `docs/onboarding-research.md` §5 — every screen skippable, safety plan defers to Settings, PCL-5 score internal only. The current app instead offers a one-screen optional sensory-preference setup or defaults; it does not surface the PCL-5 or ask for trigger situations, a safety phrase, or a trusted contact. The broader `domain/onboarding` state machine remains a model, not the runtime flow.

## Post-SOS check-in (locked: model built, notification + UI on SDK machine)
One gentle notification ~10–15 min after SOS (AlarmManager; discreet text
"Anchor: how are you doing?" — never clinical wording on a lock screen).
Opens optional 3-tap flow: trigger chips + distress 1–5 + ≤280-char note
(`domain/followup`, 15 tests), each independently skippable, once per
episode, dismiss = never re-asked. Lands in Episode → therapist export.
Support directory (`domain/support`: 9 entries + `forRegion()`, 18 tests)
backs the Find Support screen. This episode-linked check-in is the ONLY
allowed re-prompt — scheduled/repeated assessments stay banned.

## Custom routines (sequence model built; simplified preference editor shipped)
The USP: user builds calming routines (own audio/voice clips, haptics,
breathing, pauses) and binds one to the panic button. Spec (`domain/routine/`,
21 tests): `RoutineStep` = Haptic(patternId, intensity 0..1, durationSec) |
Breathing(1..120s) | SafetyPhrase(clipId) | Pause(1..120s); `Routine` max 8
steps, max 180s total; `RoutineValidator` collects all failures. The app's
“My Anchor routine” screen selects one primary comfort tool and optional media
preferences, which are persisted and used in SOS. The separate ordered
sequence model has no reorderable builder, sequence persistence, or multi-step
playback. Recording UI and sequence binding are not built.

## Panic button (LOCKED: medical default, user-editable)
Ships a medically-based default sequence — E007 tactile anchor →
E004 paced breathing → check-in — that the user can edit (reorder, toggle,
duration via `RoutineValidator`; voice-recording builder is Tier1, not
demo). Answers "allow edits to it": yes, lite editor, no audio recording
for the demo.
Full SOS flow (locked): SOS → default breathing sequence → check-in →
consent gate ("comfortable talking about it?") → journal/note (≤280
chars, skippable) → incident kind picker (`domain/triage`: 9
situation-language kinds → CurrentState + starter E-ids, 22 tests; never
trauma-origin/diagnosis language) → router recommendations → Get Support
→ Track Progress (episodes, goals, med reminders tracking-only with no
dosage fields, PCL-5 once). Meds: `domain/meds` (reminders + taken log
only, never advice; 12 tests). Goals: `domain/goals` (behavioral, weekly
progress; 20 tests).

## Routing + catalog (locked: models built, wiring later)
`domain/content`: 9 pre-authored interventions E001–E009 per plan.md §8.3
with `EvidenceStatus` + `toSafetyCandidate()` bridge (10 tests).
`domain/routing`: `rank()` pipeline — drop alreadyTried → safety permits →
successRate sort → SF7 fallback, never empty (14 tests). E009 brown noise
flagged EVIDENCE_GAP, never primary. Wiring into session flow + UI NOT built yet.

## Profile + history (models, local persistence, and core preference UI wired)
`domain/profile`: `UserProfile` per plan.md (sensory prefs, vetoes,
contacts, no narrative field by design) + `toSafetyProfile()` bridge +
validator (17 tests) plus local `UserProfileStore` and profile editor. The
profile has no trauma narrative. `domain/history`: `Episode` record and
`EpisodeStore`; app uses a JSON-backed SharedPreferences implementation for
episodes and session outcomes. The optional first-run screen saves preferences
and offers a defaults path. Broader questionnaire/onboarding screens and
follow-up scheduling remain unimplemented.

## Content library + You-are-not-alone (locked: specs, UI later)
Exercises: adapt public-domain/clinical protocols (5-4-3-2-1, breathing
ratios, Jacobson PMR, sleep hygiene, coping statements, DBT paraphrase
only — Guilford enforces), own wording always, never copy worksheets.
BUILT as data: `GuidedScripts` (9 scripts: +monsoon/temple visualizations, +`breathing_478_sleep`; tests), `CopingStatements` (25, +NORMALIZE) + `SleepChecklist` (10 items; 10 tests), `MapsQueries` (3 presets; 4 tests). Most UI readers NOT built — exception: the **Sleep** tool (Tools hub) reads `SleepChecklist` + `breathing_478_sleep` and adds a CBT-I sleep diary (`domain/sleep`: `SleepEntry`/`SleepMetrics`/`SleepValidator`, total-sleep-time + sleep-efficiency, 7-night trends; `data/SleepLogStore`) and `domain/content/SleepEducation`. Psychoeducation only — no sleep-restriction prescription, no IRT, no reminders (`evidence.md` §15).
24 bundled safety phrases (`domain/content/SafetyPhraseBank`, 10 tests) + custom recordings (≤15s, present tense, no
narrative clause, preview + confirm; `isAcceptable` guards text form). You-are-not-alone order: crisis
helplines (offline) → Maps button (`geo:0,0?q=`, no permission needed,
online-badged) → therapist directories → peer communities last with
caveats ("browse when stable"). Spec: `docs/content-sources.md`.

## Session loop (M5 extended — HOLD on replace vs extend)
`IDLE → ACTIVATING → GROUNDING → EASING → CHECK_IN → RECOVERY`, plus `ROUTING → INTERVENTION → SAFETY_STOP` (M5).
OPEN: extend M5 incrementally vs rebuild full plan.md §15. No new states until team unblocks.

## Demo story (LOCKED: reliability)
Tap ANCHOR NOW → haptic grounds you → check-in → SMS template → privacy
close. All other scripts killed. UI build priority follows this order.

## Demo lock (MUST genuinely work on the day)
MUST (reliability path): ANCHOR NOW ✅ built · haptic grounding ✅ built ·
check-in ✅ built · SMS template ❌ (~2–3h: pre-written templates via
ACTION_SENDTO, no auto-send) · privacy close ❌ (~1h: end card + data
statement, no deletion theater).
PLUS (differentiators, cheap): Find Support India directory + regional
routing ❌ (~8h per docs/ptsd-care-india-map.md §7; manual-picker-only lite
~2h fallback) · safety plan screen ❌ (model built; form UI ~3–4h) ·
insight card ❌ (scorer built; ~1–2h).
SEED, DON'T BUILD for demo: onboarding profile (spec S0–S12 exists;
ship seeded profile; build flow only if MUST+PLUS done).
CUT for demo: volume clutch, routine builder UI, voice recording,
brown noise, Learn module, graphs.
BORROW from PTSD Coach (content patterns only, own words + evidence
labels — techniques like paced breathing, 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, PMR,
sleep hygiene are standard clinical procedures; our E001–E009 already
follows this pattern): exercise content shapes, Stanley-Brown structure
(published protocol), SUDS concept (adapted to Better/Same/Worse).
NEVER borrow: forced assessments, repeat reminders, crisis-line spam,
veteran framing.
Novelty order (pitch-safe): offline zero-permission ★5, dissociation
routing ★5, outcome rerank ★4 (mechanism only), custom voice ★4
(neuroscience-informed), regional routing ★4. Never claim as clinical
fact: haptics proven, vagal regulation, BLS app, personalization
improves outcomes, voice reduces anxiety. Full brief:
`docs/exercise-evidence.md`.

## Journaling (locked: structured built, photo Tier1, narrative banned)
Built: Episode + SessionOutcome + insight records WHAT HELPED, never what
happened. Tier1: voluntary trigger-photo log — user taps, CameraX captures
to app-private storage, timestamped + linked to episode + optional short
note; blurred thumbnails, no auto-review/slideshow, export-to-therapist
framing (photos can re-trigger on re-view). Banned unless the team
explicitly overrides: free-text trauma narrative fields (plan.md acceptance
criterion), passive/automatic capture of any kind (photo or audio),
anything captured leaving the device.

## Killed / deferred
- KILL for demo: Django/Channels backend, Deepgram+Groq+ElevenLabs chain, ambient upload, passive EMA, trauma-type diagnosis cards, Ed25519.
- STRETCH order: volume clutch PROTOTYPE BUILT (widget + 600ms long-press, screen-on/locked-awake only, static 5-sense script, camera removed; Tier1, never demo-default — full verdict in docs/clutch-research.md) → on-device loudness whisper → brown noise (comfort-labeled) → Purr/Marble.
  **Update (2026-09-05): the volume-clutch prototype is now built**, not
  just researched — `trigger/AnchorAccessibilityService.kt` (ported from
  Nugon's verified long-press pattern, screen-on/locked-awake only, no
  MediaSession deep-sleep bypass) plus a second, simpler home-screen
  widget trigger (`widget/GroundingWidget.kt`), both converging on
  `ui/grounding/GroundingCaptureScreen.kt`: one photo, on-device ML Kit
  object labeling, a template-built "things you can see" script, photo
  never persisted. Kept fully off the demo-critical path (`HomeScreen`'s
  `ANCHOR NOW` flow is untouched) — available as the stretch item this
  section already calls for, not a replacement for it. Verified: full
  build/tests green, and the shared capture flow confirmed end-to-end on
  an emulator (real CameraX capture, on-device labeling, script render,
  no file ever written to disk/MediaStore, camera-permission-denied
  fallback). NOT yet verified: the volume long-press's key interception
  on real hardware — the accessibility service registers and binds
  correctly, but the emulator's synthetic volume-key input never reached
  `onKeyEvent()`, so this specific mechanism still needs a real-device
  check before being demoed, exactly per this doc's own caveats above.

## India-first support (locked: directory spec, UI later)
PTSD Coach ships US-only numbers; India gets nothing. Anchor bundles an
India-ready Find Support directory (`docs/india-resources.md`): Tele MANAS
**14416** default, 112 emergency, Vandrevala 9999666555 (incl. WhatsApp),
NIMHANS, iCall, Sneha, Kashmir Lifeline, AASRA + therapist URL (badged
offline-unavailable). Phone-first (all work offline by call).
Directory only — we provide and integrate nothing: no booking, no accounts,
no backend, no live clinic lookup. "Free-first" means free-to-call
third-party helplines listed first, not free therapy from us. "Near you"
for demo = curated static entries + directory URLs; live location lookup
is stretch (permission-gated, optional). Pointing alone beats PTSD Coach's
nothing. Numbers must be re-verified before release.
Near-you verdict (locked): no live street-level clinic lookup — needs
online Places billing or GBs of offline data, both kill offline-first.
Ship region-mapped static directory instead: bundled ~25KB state table,
optional one-shot COARSE fix (never stored, never sent), manual 36-state
picker fallback. Spec: `docs/ptsd-care-india-map.md` §7 (near-you verdict folded in).
Pincode beats GPS: user types 6-digit PIN → first-2-digit state table
(~28 rows, <1KB), zero permissions, fully offline. Institution map
(apex/DMHP/NGO/private, 20 seed entries): `docs/ptsd-care-india-map.md`.
