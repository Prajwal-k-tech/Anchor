## Runtime Features

### ANCHOR NOW session

The main user flow is exposed from `MainActivity` and `HomeScreen`:

1. The user taps **ANCHOR NOW**.
2. The app enters the session state machine.
3. Haptic grounding starts immediately.
4. The user can follow the breathing/grounding visual state.
5. The session can finish with a Better/Same/Worse outcome.

The UI is intentionally small and offline-first. The session state machine is
plain Kotlin, so it can be tested without an Android device and does not make
emergency calls, send messages, or perform network requests.

### Haptic grounding

Haptics are isolated behind the `HapticEngine` interface. This keeps Android
hardware APIs out of the domain layer and allows the same UI to run with a
debug fake on an emulator.

Implemented haptic patterns include:

- `DOUBLE_PULSE`: two gentle tactile taps for an immediate grounding cue.
- `SLOW_PULSE`: a single slow repeating pulse.
- `BREATHING_IN`: a four-second intensity ramp for inhalation.
- `BREATHING_OUT`: a six-second intensity ramp for exhalation.
- `TEST_PULSE`: a developer-only engine check.

`SystemHapticEngine` uses Android vibration hardware. It reports device
capabilities and scales intensity. `DebugHapticEngine` provides a visible test
stand-in when hardware is unavailable. Haptics are interaction mechanisms, not
biometric sensing or a clinical treatment claim.

<!-- AUTO:CORE_HAPTICS:START -->
- `DebugHapticEngine` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/haptics/DebugHapticEngine.kt`: A non-hardware [HapticEngine] for the emulator, where nothing physically vibrates. This engine never claims otherwise: [play] always returns false, and [capabilities] honestly reports no vibrator. What it *does* provide is [activePulse], a plain Kotlin StateFlow (no Compose dependency here) that a later UI layer can collect to render an on-screen visual stand-in for the haptic while developing off-device.
- `DebugPulse` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/haptics/DebugHapticEngine.kt`: What debug pattern is "playing", for a future visual pulse to render.
- `HapticCapabilities` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/haptics/HapticCapabilities.kt`: What the current device/engine can actually do. Callers (and a later Settings screen) use this to decide whether to show a haptic-unavailable fallback rather than assuming vibration always works.
- `HapticEngine` (interface) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/haptics/HapticEngine.kt`: The hardware boundary for vibration. Nothing outside this package should import android.os.Vibrator / VibratorManager / VibrationEffect directly — every other layer (session logic, UI) depends on this interface instead, so it can run against [DebugHapticEngine] on an emulator and [SystemHapticEngine] on a device without changing a single call site. Deliberately not Compose-aware: this is plain Kotlin so it stays testable and reusable from services/receivers that have no Compose context.
- `createHapticEngine` (fun) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/haptics/HapticEngineFactory.kt`: The single, canonical place that decides which [HapticEngine] to use. Previously duplicated privately inside two devtools screens; now a real product screen needs the exact same decision, so it lives here instead — one heuristic, not three copies of it. The heuristic itself only matters for development: on a real phone this will always resolve to [SystemHapticEngine]. It exists so the emulator (which cannot vibrate) gets [DebugHapticEngine] instead, without anyone needing to switch that by hand.
- `HapticPattern` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/haptics/HapticPattern.kt`: A device-agnostic vibration waveform. Maps directly onto [android.os.VibrationEffect.createWaveform]: [timings] are millisecond durations, [amplitudes] (0-255, or null for default amplitude) are the strength for each timing entry, and [repeatIndex] is the index to loop back to (-1 for no repeat). This module defines the shape only. Named, tuned patterns (double pulse, slow pulse, breathing, and future textures) live in [HapticPatterns].
- `HapticPatterns` (object) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/haptics/HapticPatterns.kt`: The catalog of named, deterministic haptic patterns Anchor can play. Smooth breathing wave patterns calibrated to match the visualizer UI.
- `SystemHapticEngine` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/haptics/SystemHapticEngine.kt`: Real vibration hardware, reached through the platform APIs. Every Android call in here is wrapped defensively: a missing vibrator, an unsupported feature, or a thrown exception from the platform must never propagate out of this class. [play] and [stop] report failure by returning false / doing nothing, never by throwing.
- `scaleAmplitudes` (fun) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/haptics/SystemHapticEngine.kt`: Scales each amplitude by [intensity] (clamped 0f..1f), clamped back into VibrationEffect's valid 0..255 range. Pure function — no Android dependency — so it is unit-testable without a device or Robolectric. A null [amplitudes] array (default-amplitude waveform) passes through unchanged: there is nothing to scale.
<!-- AUTO:CORE_HAPTICS:END -->

### Private audio delivery

The audio boundary uses Android `TextToSpeech` and checks for private output
devices before speaking. When Bluetooth, wired, USB, BLE, or hearing-aid audio
is unavailable, the delivery engine remains silent rather than sending speech
through the phone speaker. `DebugAudioEngine` and `FakeAudioOutputDetector`
support host tests and previews.

<!-- AUTO:CORE_AUDIO:START -->
- `AudioDeliveryEngine` (interface) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/AudioDeliveryEngine.kt`: Dual-mode audio delivery engine boundary. If Bluetooth earbuds or headphones are connected: - Speaks guided scripts in a soft, private female whisper into the user's ear. If NO earbuds are connected: - Mutes audio output completely (0% speaker sound) so the app operates in 100% silent, haptic-only mode (useful in meetings, classrooms, or public spaces).
- `AudioEngineProvider` (object) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/AudioDeliveryEngine.kt`: Singleton provider to keep TTS warm in memory 24/7 across the accessibility service and app activities for zero-latency speech playback.
- `WhisperAudioEngine` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/AudioDeliveryEngine.kt`: Production Android [AudioDeliveryEngine] implementation backed by [TextToSpeech] and [AudioOutputDetector].
- `DebugAudioEngine` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/AudioDeliveryEngine.kt`: Debug/fake engine for host unit testing and Compose previews.
- `createAudioEngine` (fun) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/AudioDeliveryEngine.kt`: Factory function to instantiate the system audio delivery engine (pre-warmed singleton).
- `AudioOutputDetector` (interface) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/AudioOutputDetector.kt`: Detects whether private listening devices (Bluetooth earbuds, A2DP, SCO, BLE headset, or wired headphones) are connected to the system.
- `SystemAudioOutputDetector` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/AudioOutputDetector.kt`: System implementation backed by Android [AudioManager].
- `FakeAudioOutputDetector` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/AudioOutputDetector.kt`: Debug/fake detector for host unit testing and Compose previews.
- `CalmingPreset` (enum class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/CalmingAudioEngine.kt`: Kotlin declaration: `CalmingPreset`.
- `CalmingAudioEngine` (interface) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/CalmingAudioEngine.kt`: Interface boundary: `CalmingAudioEngine`.
- `SystemCalmingAudioEngine` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/CalmingAudioEngine.kt`: Implementation class: `SystemCalmingAudioEngine`.
- `DebugCalmingAudioEngine` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/CalmingAudioEngine.kt`: Implementation class: `DebugCalmingAudioEngine`.
- `NoiseGenerator` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/NoiseGenerator.kt`: On-device ambient-noise synthesis for the optional masking layer during a comfort tool. Synthesized in real time — no bundled or downloaded audio asset, so there's nothing to source, license, or ship in the APK. [Type.RAIN] and [Type.OCEAN] are honest signal-processing approximations built on the same pink-noise basis as [Type.PINK] — a random-walk amplitude envelope for rain's patter, a slow sine swell for ocean's waves — not recordings, and not claimed to be. Framed in the UI as "rain-like"/"wave-like" ambience, never as authentic nature audio. **Framing, deliberately:** this is comfort/masking, not noise cancellation — a phone app cannot control headset hardware ANC, and evidence for white/pink noise reducing anxiety is real but mixed and mostly studied outside PTSD (sleep, procedural anxiety). See `docs/exercise-evidence.md`. Never claim this "cancels" surrounding sound; it makes it less noticeable by playing over it in your ear. Callers are responsible for the same earbuds-only gate every other audio path in this app respects (`AudioDeliveryEngine.isWhisperModeActive`) — this class has no opinion on headset state, it just plays if started.
- `Type` (enum class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/NoiseGenerator.kt`: Kotlin declaration: `Type`.
- `PhraseRecorder` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/audio/PhraseRecorder.kt`: Thin [MediaRecorder] wrapper for the Safety Phrases recording flow. Records to app-private storage only — never external/shared storage — matching this app's on-device-only privacy stance. Caller owns the ~15s max-duration guard (`SafetyPhraseRecording.MAX_DURATION_MS`) by calling [stop] itself on a timer; this class doesn't cap duration on its own, so it stays a plain record/stop primitive the UI drives.
<!-- AUTO:CORE_AUDIO:END -->

### Vision labeler boundary

Visual grounding uses an interface-based labeler boundary. Physical devices
use the bundled offline ML Kit implementation; emulator and preview builds use
a deterministic debug labeler. The capture screen and grounding script builder
do not depend directly on ML Kit.

<!-- AUTO:CORE_VISION:START -->
- `DebugObjectLabeler` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/vision/DebugObjectLabeler.kt`: Emulator/preview-safe [ObjectLabeler]. The Android emulator's virtual camera and ML Kit's on-device model do not reliably combine to produce meaningful labels, so this returns a fixed, plausible-looking result instead — enough to exercise the whole capture -> label -> script flow without a real camera or a real model. Mirrors [com.anchor.core.haptics.DebugHapticEngine].
- `MlKitObjectLabeler` (class) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/vision/MlKitObjectLabeler.kt`: Real, on-device [ObjectLabeler] backed by ML Kit's **bundled** Image Labeling model (statically linked into the APK — see the `image-labeling` dependency in app/build.gradle.kts, chosen over the Play-Services/ unbundled variant specifically so this works immediately offline with no first-run model download). Runs entirely on-device, no network call.
- `ObjectLabeler` (interface) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/vision/ObjectLabeler.kt`: The hardware/ML boundary for turning a photo into object labels. Nothing outside this package should import ML Kit directly — every other layer (the capture screen, the grounding-script builder) depends on this interface instead, so it can run against [DebugObjectLabeler] on an emulator and [MlKitObjectLabeler] on a device without changing a single call site. Mirrors the [com.anchor.core.haptics.HapticEngine] pattern.
- `createObjectLabeler` (fun) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/core/vision/ObjectLabelerFactory.kt`: The single, canonical place that decides which [ObjectLabeler] to use. Mirrors [com.anchor.core.haptics.createHapticEngine] and its emulator heuristic exactly — same reasoning: on a real phone this always resolves to [MlKitObjectLabeler]; it exists so the emulator (whose virtual camera doesn't produce meaningful frames for a real model to label) gets [DebugObjectLabeler] instead, without anyone needing to switch it by hand.
<!-- AUTO:CORE_VISION:END -->

### Home-screen widget trigger

The Glance widget provides a low-friction shortcut from the Android home
screen. Tapping it launches `MainActivity` with
`EXTRA_LAUNCH_GROUNDING`, opening the visual grounding flow directly instead
of requiring navigation through the home screen.

### Volume-button trigger

`AnchorAccessibilityService` implements the optional volume-button long-press
trigger. It launches the same visual grounding flow as the widget, so the
trigger paths do not duplicate grounding logic.

The current implementation is scoped to screen-on or locked-but-awake use.
Deep-sleep interception and a guaranteed real-device volume-key behavior are
not claimed as supported until verified on hardware. The service must be
enabled by the user in Android Accessibility settings.

### Camera-assisted visual grounding

`GroundingCaptureScreen` performs one private camera capture and turns the
result into a short "things you can see" grounding script:

1. CameraX binds a back-camera preview and image-capture use case.
2. One frame is captured into memory.
3. ML Kit labels objects locally on the device.
4. `GroundingScriptBuilder` converts labels into deterministic grounding text.
5. Camera resources are unbound and the in-memory image is discarded.

The capture is not saved to the device, not added to the MediaStore, not
uploaded, and not shown as a photo. If camera permission is missing or capture
or labeling fails, the app uses a fixed fallback script instead of showing an
error or requesting permission from a trigger-only entry point.

### Theme and accessibility-oriented presentation

The Compose theme supports Anchor color palettes and a developer theme switcher
for testing. The UI uses large controls, short text, and a direct path to the
primary action to reduce cognitive and motor demands during distress.

## Implemented Domain Features

These modules are implemented as platform-independent Kotlin models,
validators, catalogs, or state machines. Some still need production UI or
persistence wiring.

| Feature | Technical implementation | Purpose | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Safety filtering | `SafetyFilter`, `SafetyProfile`, safety candidates, fallback intervention | Removes interventions that conflict with sensory preferences or safety rules and guarantees a non-empty fallback | Used for SOS follow-up recommendations and Manage Symptoms; profile choices are loaded from local storage |
| Intervention routing | `InterventionRouter` and `InterventionCatalog` | Excludes already-tried items, applies safety permissions, ranks by success rate, and falls back safely | Domain logic implemented |
| Session lifecycle | `SessionState`, `SessionStateMachine` | Models `IDLE`, activation, grounding, intervention, check-in, recovery, and safety-stop transitions | Runtime session path implemented; broader M5 flow remains incremental |
| User profile | `UserProfile`, `UserProfileValidator`, `UserProfileStore` | Stores sensory preferences, haptic intensity, intervention vetoes, and contact values without a trauma narrative | Optional onboarding and settings editor save locally; sensory choices affect recommendations and session output. Contact fields are not populated by these screens |
| Episode history | `Episode`, `SessionOutcome`, `EpisodeStorePersistent` | Records what helped and session outcomes without recording a trauma story | JSON-backed SharedPreferences storage is wired into session completion and progress/routing screens |
| Onboarding flow | `OnboardingFlow`, `OnboardingStep`, `OnboardingScreen` | Offers first-run preference setup and a skip-to-defaults choice | One-screen preference setup; the longer research flow and PCL-5 UI are not exposed |
| PCL-5 assessment | `Pcl5Catalog`, `Pcl5Scorer` | Provides a one-time, on-device screening score for baseline personalization | Scoring logic implemented; screening only, not diagnosis |
| Follow-up check-in | `FollowUpCheckIn`, `FollowUpValidator` | Models a short optional post-session check-in with trigger, distress, and note fields | Domain logic implemented; notification/UI wiring pending |
| Personalization | `PersonalizationScorer`, `SessionOutcome` | Calculates simple evidence from Better/Same/Worse outcomes and avoids acute-path scales | Scoring logic implemented |
| Guided content | `GuidedScripts`, `CopingStatements`, `SleepChecklist` | Bundles 8 grounding, breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, coping, and sleep items for offline use | Content data implemented; reader UI pending |
| Safety phrases | `SafetyPhraseBank` and phrase validation | Supplies bundled grounding phrases and validates short user-recorded phrase text | Bundled content and validation implemented; recording/playback UI pending |
| Safety plan | `SafetyPlan`, `SafetyPlanValidator`, `SafetyPlanStore` | Holds six sections of user-entered safety notes | Local form, validation, persistence, and display in the safety-stop screen; display-only with no automatic contact actions |
| My Anchor routine | `AnchorRoutinePreferences` | Chooses one comfort tool with optional audio, ambient sound, and safe-place media | SharedPreferences-backed editor is wired to the SOS flow. The separate ordered `Routine` model still has no multi-step builder or playback |
| Support directory | `SupportDirectory`, `SupportEntry`, `PinRegions`, `MapsQueries` | Provides offline-first India support entries, PIN-prefix regional lookup, and map intents | Directory data and `FindSupportScreen` implemented; live map/browser destinations require external apps/network |
| Visual grounding scripts | `GroundingScript`, `GroundingScriptBuilder` | Converts object labels into short deterministic sensory prompts | Runtime implementation active in the camera flow |

## Privacy and Safety Controls

- No backend, cloud database, LLM, or speech-to-text service is required at
  runtime. Optional spoken delivery uses the device's local Android
  `TextToSpeech` service.
- No trauma narrative field is present in the profile or episode model.
- Camera grounding uses an in-memory frame and discards it after labeling.
- The app does not automatically call emergency services or contact a trusted
  person.
- Safety filtering uses the saved sensory preferences before intervention
  selection. The direct comfort tool remains user-selected; haptic intensity,
  touch sensitivity, and voice/audio preferences are applied to that path.
- Dissociation and worsening outcomes have dedicated safety-stop behavior in
  the domain state model.
- Missing camera permission and camera failures degrade to a local fallback
  instead of blocking the grounding experience.

## Android Permissions and Components

The manifest currently declares:

- `CAMERA`, optional because visual grounding has a text fallback.
- `VIBRATE`, for hardware haptic patterns.
- `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE`, required by Android to bind the optional
  volume-button trigger service.

Registered Android components are:

- `MainActivity`, the launcher and Compose host.
- `GroundingWidgetReceiver`, the home-screen widget receiver.
- `AnchorAccessibilityService`, the optional hardware trigger service.

## Developer and Test Features

The project includes developer-only screens for:

- Haptic pattern and engine testing.
- Session state-machine transitions.
- Intervention routing and sensory-profile combinations.
- Support directory inspection.
- Theme switching.

`FindSupportScreen` is an application support screen despite living in the
`devtools` package; the other screens in that package are developer tools.

<!-- AUTO:DEVTOOLS:START -->
- `DevHapticTestScreen` (fun) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/devtools/DevHapticTestScreen.kt`: Top-level function: `DevHapticTestScreen`.
- `FindSupportScreen` (fun) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/devtools/FindSupportScreen.kt`: Top-level function: `FindSupportScreen`.
- `RoutingLabScreen` (fun) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/devtools/RoutingLabScreen.kt`: Top-level function: `RoutingLabScreen`.
- `SessionStateTestScreen` (fun) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/devtools/SessionStateTestScreen.kt`: Top-level function: `SessionStateTestScreen`.
- `ThemeSwitcher` (fun) in `app/src/main/java/com/anchor/devtools/ThemeSwitcher.kt`: Top-level function: `ThemeSwitcher`.
<!-- AUTO:DEVTOOLS:END -->

The domain layer is deliberately Android-independent where possible. This
supports fast JUnit testing of validators, routing, scoring, onboarding,
content, safety rules, routines, and state transitions without an emulator.

## Not Yet Production Features

The following are represented by specifications or domain models but should
not be described as fully shipped runtime features yet:

- Reorderable multi-step routine persistence and playback using the separate
  `domain/routine.Routine` sequence model.
- PCL-5 onboarding UI, trigger-situation collection, and editable profile veto
  lists.
- AlarmManager notification scheduling for post-session check-ins.
- Trusted-contact SMS intent and privacy-close end card.
- Full support-directory user screen and regional selection UI.
- User voice recording and playback.
- Brown noise, ambient audio processing, passive EMA, and background capture.
- Deep-sleep volume-button interception.

These boundaries keep the MVP offline, deterministic, private, and small enough
to verify reliably on Android hardware.
